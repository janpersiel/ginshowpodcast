This is what you think it is: We are announcing our podcast about gin! Since 2016 we, Belinda and Jan, have been navigating the gin oceans and despite the fact that an annoying number of time-zones and oceans lay between them this podcast unites our mutual interest in promoting quality gins and sharing knowledge about distilleries. And yes we will try to get you excited about the gins we talk about. Stay tuned for more and Cheers!
